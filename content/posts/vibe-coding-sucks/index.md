_Shout out to my friend [Edoardo Vacchi](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edoardovacchi_pro-tip-spoof-your-user-agent-to-an-ai-crawler-activity-7356006270731988993-sA2s?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAHtz1EBYxpmoS7uy_akSEiqgWEq7M1OxNU)_


I kept hearing about vibe coding here and there until someone sent me an article about "vibe coding". The article went deep into "prompt engineering" and how LLMs will eventually replace us all. The other day, a (non-tech) friend bragged about creating a bot for Discord without writing a single line of code - just to get back a few days later to me saying that he got into an endless rabbit hole.

This speech of letting the AI do your job - just be good at prompting - can be a real trap for software engineers, mainly juniors.

I'm not gonna lie. I (as well as many others I know) have been using LLMs for **code assistance**. If you are not in this wagon, you should. In this article I'll go through a few areas where prompting can really help you boost your productivity, enhance your creativity, and critical thinking.

## Exploring Ideas
When you have that big idea for a new project, try looking for alternatives and validation for what you are trying to do. 

For example:

> I have this great idea of a platform where people can take photos of their grocery receipts, upload it, and keep track of their expenses. The software can combine data minining, with models that can predict shopping behavior, integrate with Amazon, ...

The more specific details you can give to the model, the better. There are even tools that you can use to do deep search and analyses that will create reports detailing each aspect from your requirements.

You can even use this opportunity to brainstorm with the machine to pre-validate what you are trying to do before bringing to your team or peers.

## Templating
Instead of asking the AI things like "generate a shopping cart application".

## Patterns and Best Practices

## Code Review

## Scripting

<!-- Conclusion -->
Remember, all the data generated by the AI is based knowledge spread over the internet from forums, papers, articles, and so on. Someone has coded something pretty similar to what was generated, it's not your code.
